<h1 align = "center"><samp>About</samp></h1>
<h4><samp>This model is used to detect potholes. The name of the pretrained model is "pothole.pt". This model is trained using a public dataset which had a collection 
of 665 images of roads with the potholes labeled. I will share the link to the dataset at the end! It has one class annotated which is "pothole". I have trained this model 
using the YOLOv5 model using 100 epochs and a batch size of 8. The metrics of the training will also be attached here.

<h1 align = "center"><samp>Setup</samp></h1>
<h4><samp>1) Clone this repository. </samp></h4>
<h4><samp>2) Change the working directory to this repository. </samp></h4>
<h4><samp>3) you can directly run the "main.py" file. This file will firstly get the required dependencies from the "requirements.txt". You will also have to change or modify the main file for inference. If you are doing it for video, you can directly put the file path. If you are doing it for images or live video feed, you will have to modify the file accordingly. </samp></h4>
<h4><samp>Note: After running the "main.py" file once, you can remove the part where you get the dependencies!</samp></h4>
