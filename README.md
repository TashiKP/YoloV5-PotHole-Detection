<h4><samp>This model is used to detect potholes. The name of the pretrained model is "pothole.pt". This model is trained using a public dataset which had a collection 
of 665 images of roads with the potholes labeled. I will share the link to the dataset at the end! It has one class annotated which is "pothole". I have trained this model 
using the YOLOv5 model using 100 epochs and a batch size of 8. The metrics of the training will also be attached here.
